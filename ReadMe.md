# TOKEN2022 - Pumpfun Smart Contract Overview

This document outlines the intricacies of the Pumpfun smart contract that utilizes the new SPL token standard, TOKEN2022. This advanced token protocol extends the functionalities of conventional SPL tokens, providing developers with more versatile options for implementing tokenomics in decentralized applications.

## Why Choose TOKEN2022

TOKEN2022 represents a significant evolution of the SPL token program, offering various additional functionalities beyond what traditional SPL tokens can provide. These enhancements may include features such as tax handling, programmatic governance, or custom fee structures, which can facilitate more sophisticated financial operations within decentralized ecosystems.
